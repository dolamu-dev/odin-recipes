Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create a basic recipe website that will 
link to recipes for people to look through. This website won't look very 
pretty, however, by doing this, I will get to demonstrate all the knowledge
I have accumulated so far on basic HTML skills - like wrtiing the boilerplate
from scratch, while utilising some elements like paragraphs <p>, anchor <a>
for links, image <img>, ordered <ol> and unordered <ol> list elements <li>, etc.
